Story:
DISPLAY GAMES 
The user interface portion of the application will retrieve the games data via the database defined in the 
Database Specification section below. Games will be separated into those that we currently want, and those than 
we own. The games that we want will display the current vote count, and must be sorted by this vote count in 
descending order. The games that we own must be sorted alphabetically, and will not display the vote count.
